# Robustness Tree Code

This toolkit processes MMLU questions, merges them with **DOVE robustness scores**, and generates **model weakness profiles** for deeper performance analysis.

## Python Files Flow

1. **`extract_mmlu_questions.py`**  
   Extracts questions from **MMLU** and creates a JSON file mapping MMLU questions to their indices.

2. **`extract_dove_scores_Llama.py`**, **`extract_dove_scores_OLMoE.py`**  
   Extracts **DOVE scores** for LLaMA and OLMoE models.

3. **`merge_dove_score_with_mmlu_accuracy_score.py`**  
   Merges a modelâ€™s DOVE score with the corresponding MMLU question index.

4. **`replace_accuracy_ranking_in_DOVE.py`**  
   Replaces the accuracy score in **EvalTree** with the DOVE robustness score.

5. **`weakness_question_generator.py`**  
   Generates a **weakness profile** based on the integrated scores.
