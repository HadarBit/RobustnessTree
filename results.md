Absolutely! You're right - let's show the agreement at the granular level of all individual capabilities, not just the Level 2 groupings. This will give us a much more detailed and meaningful comparison.
Now let's clean up the old files and run the updated analysis:
```bash
rm -f tree_based_agreement_matrix.png tree_based_agreement_analysis.json
```
```bash
python3 extract_continuous_weaknesses.py
```
Perfect! Let's check the results and verify the visualization:
```bash
ls -la *.png *.json | grep -E "(individual|capability)"
```
```bash
jq '.individual_capability_analysis.summary_stats' individual_capability_agreement_analysis.json
```
Let me also check which specific capabilities agree and disagree:
```bash
jq '.individual_capability_analysis.agreement_matrix | to_entries[] | select(.value.both_detect == true) | .key' individual_capability_agreement_analysis.json
```
```bash
jq '.individual_capability_analysis.agreement_matrix | to_entries[] | select(.value.agreement == false) | {capability: .key, dove: .value.dove_detects, ranking: .value.ranking_detects}' individual_capability_agreement_analysis.json
```
## ðŸŽ¯ **Perfect! Individual Capability Agreement Analysis Complete**

Now we have the granular analysis you requested! Here are the key findings:

### ðŸ“Š **Individual Capability Agreement Statistics:**
- **11 individual capabilities** analyzed (all specific weak capabilities found)
- **36.4% Overall Agreement Rate** (much lower than grouped categories, showing real differences)
- **4 capabilities both methods agree are weak**
- **3 capabilities only Dove ranking detects as weak**
- **4 capabilities only Original ranking detects as weak**
- **0 capabilities neither detects** (all capabilities are weak in at least one method)

### ðŸŸ¢ **Capabilities Both Methods Agree Are Weak:**
1. **Analyzing and applying mathematical and algebraic principles and structures**
2. **Analyzing and evaluating logical, mathematical, and linguistic structures**
3. **Analyzing and synthesizing electrical systems and principles**
4. **Evaluating and analyzing complex information for validity and logical consistency**

### ðŸ”´ **Disagreements:**

**Dove Only (3 capabilities):**
- Applying mathematical reasoning and problem-solving techniques
- Performing advanced mathematical and quantitative reasoning
- Performing quantitative analysis and numerical reasoning

**Original Ranking Only (4 capabilities):**
- Analyzing and evaluating logical fallacies and reasoning in arguments
- Analyzing and evaluating security systems and measures for vulnerabilities
- Analyzing and synthesizing philosophical arguments and theories on ethics
- Utilizing mathematical reasoning to solve complex problems

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Insights:**
1. **Mathematical reasoning shows complex patterns** - both methods agree on some math capabilities but disagree on others
2. **Dove ranking focuses more on quantitative/computational math** while original ranking identifies more diverse reasoning weaknesses
3. **Original ranking detects philosophical/ethical reasoning weaknesses** that Dove doesn't catch
4. **Both methods consistently identify structural analysis weaknesses** (logical, electrical, information validity)

### ðŸ“ˆ **Visualization:**
The `individual_capability_agreement_matrix.png` shows a detailed dot matrix with:
- Each row = one specific capability
- Green checkmarks = both methods agree it's weak
- Red X's = disagreement
- Large dots = weakness detected, small dots = no weakness

This granular view reveals the true complexity of how different evaluation methods identify specific capability weaknesses!
