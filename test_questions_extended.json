    "question": "In the context of ethical philosophy, consider the principle of utilitarianism, which posits that actions are right if they promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number. A recent critique argues that this perspective fails to adequately address issues of justice and individual rights. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the implications of this critique while also considering a potential response from a utilitarian perspective?\n\nA. The critique emphasizes that utilitarianism can justify sacrificing the well-being of a minority for the benefit of the majority, thus neglecting individual rights, a concern that utilitarians could respond to by advocating for a rule-utilitarian approach that incorporates justice.\nB. While the critique highlights the shortcomings of utilitarianism in safeguarding minority rights, it fails to recognize that utilitarianism inherently values individual happiness equally, which would lead to consistent protection of all rights.\nC. The critique suggests that utilitarianism is fundamentally flawed because it relies on subjective measures of happiness, a point that utilitarians can counter by pointing to objective metrics developed by social scientists to quantify well-being.\nD.
