    "question": "Consider the following logical statement: \"If all roses are flowers and some flowers fade quickly, then it must be true that at least some roses fade quickly.\" Which of the following options reflects a correct evaluation of the validity of this argument, taking into account the principles of formal logic and implications?\n\nA. The argument is valid; if all members of a subset share a property with a larger set, then at least one member of that subset must also share the property.\nB. The argument is invalid; the premise only establishes that some flowers fade quickly without any implication about roses specifically.\nC. The argument is sound; the conclusion logically follows from the premises provided that all flowers are assumed to have similar properties.\nD. The argument is valid, but unsound; while the conclusion follows logically from the premises, the premises may not be true in reality.",
