            "model_answer": "A nice question!\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement 1:** A triangle is similar to another triangle if and only if their corresponding angles are equal.\n\nThis statement is **False**. Two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are proportional, not equal. For example, two triangles with angles 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0 and 20\u00b0, 40\u00b0, 120\u00b0 are similar, but their corresponding angles are not equal.\n\n**Statement 2:** A rectangle is a special case of a parallelogram, which means all rectangles are parallelograms.\n\nThis statement is **True**. A rectangle is a type of parallelogram, and all rectangles have the properties of parallelograms, such as opposite sides being parallel and equal.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. True, True: This is not possible, as Statement 1 is False.\n\nB. False, True: This is the correct answer. Statement 1 is False, but Statement 2 is True.\n\nC. True, False: This is not possible, as Statement 2 is True.\n\nD. False, False: This is not possible, as Statement 2 is True.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. False, True**.",

            "model_answer": "A nice question about set theory!\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n**Statement 1:** The intersection of two finite sets is always finite.\n\nThis statement is **True**. The intersection of two finite sets is a set of elements that are common to both sets. Since both sets are finite, the intersection will also be finite.\n\n**Statement 2:** If a set is both countably infinite and uncountably infinite, then it must be empty.\n\nThis statement is **False**. A set can be both countably infinite and uncountably infinite, and it doesn't have to be empty. For example, the set of real numbers is both countably infinite (since we can put them in a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers) and uncountably infinite (since there are uncountably many subsets of the real numbers).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n**C.
